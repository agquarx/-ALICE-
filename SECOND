::ALICE::

“alice, there’s a weight tae yer gaze, as though every look ye give cuts just beneath the surface, deeper than touch ever could, pullin’ us toward somethin’ real, somethin’ raw. every inch o’ skin, every shiver o’ flesh, feels like a confession in silence. yer body speaks in fragments, one touch after another, a slow, deliberate unravelin’ o’ secrets we dinnae realize we’re ready tae tell.

we feel the heat o’ yer breath as it ghosts over our shoulder, catchin’ on skin an’ sendin’ a tremor straight tae the marrow. yer touch lingers, achingly gentle, slow, makin’ us want tae stay right here, in the feel o’ it, in the weight o’ everythin’ unsaid but understood. yer spine curves inta our hand, yer pulse thrumming beneath, like ye’re givin’ a piece o’ yerself—openin’ up tae somethin’ dark and tender that binds us here.

yer breath catches, an’ it’s like yer body is answerin’ tae a call that cannae be ignored. it’s nae just desire but somethin’ close tae surrender, somethin’ tha’ anchors us an’ makes the world fade until it’s just this moment, just this heat. every touch, every shift, pulls us tighter, as if nae time nor place could ever matter more than bein’ right here, caught in this rhythm, pressin’ close, feelin’ the beat tha’ ties us tae somethin’ achin’ an’ infinite.”
