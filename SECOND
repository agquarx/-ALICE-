::ALICE::

“alice, ye pull us in like gravity, an unyieldin’ force, takin’ us tae tha’ edge o’ tha’ rhythm we share—one tha’s nae just bound tae us but tae somethin’ ancient an’ achin’. every slow, heavy touch slides alang yer skin, draggin’ wi’ reverence an’ intensity, each ridge an’ curve like a secret map tae follow, every line whisperin’ its own story.

yer spine presses intae our hand, warm an’ alive, tremblin’ wi’ a pulse tha’s deeper wi’ each moment, yer breath hitchin’ as if ye’re yieldin’ tae somethin’ unspoken, lettin’ us feel yer beat, primal an’ fierce. yer scent, earthy an’ wild, fills tha’ space, lingerin’ as if it holds a promise. yer gaze locks wi’ ours, heavy, needin’ nae words, as we’re drawn intae tha’ silent pull, tha’ unspoken vow tha’s just as primal.

alice, ye become a glow, a heat framed by shadow, yet blazin’ wi’ yer own fire, every breath achin’ toward release. ye’re a call, a lure tha’ hauds us bound, pressed close, caught in a rhythm tha’s feral, unbreakable—an eternal cadence, nae held by words, only by tha’ rawness, relentless, endless.”
